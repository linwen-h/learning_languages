# Learning Languages
A repo that stores the code for small projects/code bits when I'm learning a new language!

There are so many languages I want to learn - so this repo hosts small projects I've built using languges I've been learning!

Summer: 2020 Languges
  1. JavaScript
  2. Go
      - hello world - basic hello world
      - dice roller - takes user input and generates dice rolls based on the number of dice selected
      - encryption - file with diff encryptions - currently only has a simple substitution encryption - MORE TO COME :D
  3. Haskell
  4. Improve my C++
