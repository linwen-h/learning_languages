# Learning Languages
A repo that stores the code for small projects/code bits when I'm learning a new language!

There are so many languages I want to learn - so this repo hosts small projects I've built using languges I've been learning!

Summer: 2020 Languges
  1. JavaScript
  2. Go
  3. Haskell
  4. Improve my C++
